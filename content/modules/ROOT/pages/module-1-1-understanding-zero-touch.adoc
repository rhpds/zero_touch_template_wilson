* Template structure fundamentals

== What is Zero Touch?

[%collapsible]
====
Zero Touch is Red Hat's platform for creating and delivering **interactive demos, labs, workshops, and lessons** that showcase Red Hat products through hands-on experiences.

=== Purpose

* **For Users**: Quick environment provisioning (5-10 mins), step-by-step guidance, validation, and progression
* **For Developers**: Straightforward lab creation, content development, and infrastructure automation

=== Key Benefits

* **Fast Provisioning**: Labs ready in 5-10 minutes
* **Interactive Learning**: Step-by-step instructions with validation
* **Integrated Experience**: Terminal, documentation, and applications in one interface
* **Automation**: Setup, validation, and solve scripts handle complexity
* **Scalable**: Consistent platform across different lab types

== Platform Architecture

[%collapsible]
====

The Zero Touch platform consists of several integrated components working together:

=== Core Components

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Component |Purpose

|**Showroom**
|Web interface framework providing lab navigation and content

|**Antora**
|Documentation site generator that builds content from AsciiDoc files

|**Nookbag UI Bundle**
|Zero Touch-specific UI components and styling

|**AgnosticD**
|Deployment engine that provisions infrastructure and runs automation

|**OpenShift CNV**
|Container Native Virtualization platform hosting VMs and containers

|**Wetty**
|Web-based SSH terminal access to lab VMs
|===

=== How It Works

. **Repository Clone**: Your lab content is pulled from Git
. **Content Build**: AsciiDoc files become interactive web content
. **Infrastructure Setup**: VMs and containers are provisioned automatically
. **User Access**: Students get a unified interface with terminals, docs, and apps
. **Validation**: Scripts check progress and enable next steps

== Lab Development Workflow

Creating a lab follows this progression:

. **Plan**: Define learning objectives and required infrastructure
. **Configure**: Set up VMs, containers, networks, and firewall rules
. **Create Content**: Write step-by-step instructions in AsciiDoc
. **Configure UI**: Set up navigation, tabs, and interactive elements
. **Test Locally**: Validate everything works as expected
. **Deploy**: Push changes and provision the lab environment

== Types of Labs You Can Create

=== Infrastructure Labs
* **RHEL Administration**: System management, user accounts, networking
* **OpenShift**: Container orchestration, deployments, scaling
* **Satellite**: System management, compliance, automation

=== Development Labs  
* **Ansible**: Automation, playbooks, roles
* **Container Development**: Podman, Buildah, container creation
* **Application Modernization**: Migration strategies, cloud-native patterns

=== Solution Labs
* **Multi-tier Applications**: Web servers, databases, load balancers
* **DevOps Pipelines**: CI/CD, testing, deployment automation
* **Security**: Authentication, encryption, compliance

== What Makes Zero Touch Different?

=== Traditional Approach
* Manual environment setup
* Static documentation
* Separate terminal access
* Limited validation
* Time-consuming troubleshooting

=== Zero Touch Approach
* **Automated provisioning** with consistent environments
* **Interactive documentation** with embedded terminals
* **Integrated experience** - no context switching
* **Built-in validation** and progression tracking
* **Self-healing** with solve scripts for common issues

== Lab User Experience

When students access your lab, they get:

=== Unified Interface
* **Documentation panel** with step-by-step instructions
* **Terminal tabs** for direct system access
* **Application tabs** for web interfaces
* **Progress tracking** showing completion status

=== Interactive Features
* **Copy+Run buttons** for command execution
* **Validation checkpoints** confirming correct completion
* **Solve buttons** to auto-complete steps if stuck
* **Navigation controls** to move between modules

=== Consistent Environment
* **Pre-configured systems** ready for the lesson
* **Reliable networking** between components
* **Proper authentication** and access controls
* **Monitoring and logging** for troubleshooting

== Knowledge Check
