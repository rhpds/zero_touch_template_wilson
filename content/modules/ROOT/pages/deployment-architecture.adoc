= Zero Touch Deployment Architecture

Understanding how your Zero Touch labs get deployed is crucial for advanced customization and troubleshooting. This guide explains the backend deployment process and integration patterns.

== 🏗️ Architecture Overview

Zero Touch labs use a sophisticated deployment pipeline that transforms your template repository into running lab environments:

```
[Your Lab Repo] → [AgnosticD] → [OpenShift CNV] → [Running Lab]
      ↓               ↓              ↓              ↓
   Template        Config        Infrastructure   Student
   Content         Engine        Deployment       Experience
```

=== Key Components

**🔧 AgnosticD**: The deployment engine that orchestrates infrastructure provisioning
**📦 AgnosticV**: The catalog system that defines lab configurations and metadata  
**🎨 Showroom**: The UI framework that presents your content to students
**☁️ OpenShift CNV**: The virtualization platform hosting your lab VMs

== 📁 Backend Repository Structure

Your lab template integrates with two backend systems:

=== AgnosticD Configuration
Located at: `agnosticd/ansible/configs/zero-touch-base-rhel/`

[source,yaml]
----
zero-touch-base-rhel/
├── default_vars_openshift_cnv.yaml    # CNV platform defaults
├── default_vars.yml                   # Base configuration
├── software.yml                       # Software installation
├── post_software.yml                  # Post-deployment tasks
└── README.adoc                        # Config documentation
----

**Purpose**: Defines how infrastructure is created, configured, and managed.

=== AgnosticV Catalog Entry  
Located at: `agnosticv_all/zt-rhelbu-agnosticv/zt-rhelbu/[your-lab]/`

[source,yaml]
----
your-lab/
├── common.yaml        # Shared configuration
├── dev.yaml          # Development settings  
├── prod.yaml         # Production settings
├── test.yaml         # Testing configuration
└── description.adoc  # Catalog description
----

**Purpose**: Defines catalog metadata, deployment parameters, and environment-specific overrides.

== 🔄 Deployment Process

=== Phase 1: Configuration Resolution
The deployment system dynamically fetches your lab configuration:

[source,yaml]
----
# From AgnosticV common.yaml
git_config_directory: |-
  {{ ocp4_workload_showroom_content_git_repo |
    replace('.git','/refs/heads/' + ref + '/config/') |
    replace('github.com','raw.githubusercontent.com') }}

# Dynamic configuration loading
instances: "{{ lookup('url', git_config_directory + 'instances.yaml') | from_yaml }}"
networks: "{{ lookup('url', git_config_directory + 'networks.yaml') | from_yaml }}"
firewall: "{{ lookup('url', git_config_directory + 'firewall.yaml') | from_yaml }}"
----

**🔍 What This Means**: Your `config/` directory files are fetched directly from your Git repository during deployment.

=== Phase 2: Infrastructure Provisioning
AgnosticD uses your configuration to create:

**🖥️ Virtual Machines**: Based on your `instances.yaml`
**🌐 Networks**: Defined in `networks.yaml`  
**🔥 Firewall Rules**: From `firewall.yaml`
**🔒 Security Groups**: Automatically configured for isolation

=== Phase 3: Software Installation
The platform installs and configures:

**📦 Base Packages**: RHEL repositories and essential software
**👤 User Accounts**: Creates `rhel` user with secure password
**🔑 SSH Access**: Configures terminal access for Showroom
**🤖 Automation**: Runs your `setup-automation/` scripts

=== Phase 4: Showroom Deployment
Your content is packaged and deployed:

**📚 Content Build**: Antora generates your documentation
**🎨 UI Integration**: Showroom creates the student interface  
**🔌 Terminal Access**: Wetty provides browser-based SSH
**🌍 URL Generation**: Creates unique URLs for each lab instance

== 🔧 Key Integration Points

=== Git Repository Integration

Your repository structure directly maps to deployment configuration:

[source,yaml]
----
# Your repo structure
your-lab/
├── config/           → Fetched during deployment
├── content/          → Built into Antora site  
├── setup-automation/ → Executed during provisioning
├── runtime-automation/ → Available during lab execution
├── site.yml          → Antora configuration
└── ui-config.yml     → Showroom UI settings
----

=== Password Management

The platform generates secure passwords automatically:

[source,yaml]
----
# From AgnosticD
common_password: >-
  {{
    lookup('password', output_dir ~ '/common_password length=12 chars=ascii_letters,digits')
  }}

# Student access
student_password: "{{ common_password }}"
ansible_service_account_user_password: "{{ common_password }}"
----

**🔒 Security**: Each deployment gets a unique, randomly generated password.

=== Environment Variables

Your content has access to deployment-specific variables:

[source,yaml]
----
# Available in your templates
guid: "{{ guid }}"                    # Unique deployment ID
domain: "{{ sandbox_openshift_apps_domain }}" # Platform domain
common_password: "{{ common_password }}"      # Generated password
----

**💡 Usage**: Use these in your content with `{guid}`, `{domain}`, etc.

== 🚀 Platform Features

=== OpenShift CNV Integration

Your VMs run on OpenShift Container Native Virtualization:

**🔧 Features**:
- **Kubernetes-native VM management**
- **Automatic scheduling and resource management**  
- **Network isolation between lab deployments**
- **Persistent storage for VM disks**

=== Showroom UI Framework

The student interface provides:

**🎯 Navigation**: Multi-module content organization
**🖥️ Terminals**: Browser-based SSH access to your VMs
**📱 Responsive**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
**🎨 Customizable**: Configurable tabs, solve buttons, external links

== 📊 Deployment Metadata

=== Babylon/AgnosticV Integration

Your labs integrate with Red Hat's lab catalog system:

[source,yaml]
----
__meta__:
  catalog:
    namespace: babylon-catalog-prod
    display_name: "Your Lab Name"
    category: Workshops
    keywords:
      - rhel
      - zero-touch
  deployer:
    execution_environment:
      image: quay.io/agnosticd/ee-multicloud:v1.2
----

=== Resource Management

**⏱️ Lifespan**: Labs have configurable runtime limits
**🔒 Access Control**: Integration with Red Hat SSO
**📈 Reporting**: Usage analytics and cost tracking
**⚖️ Quotas**: Resource limits per user/organization

== 🛠️ Advanced Configuration

=== Custom Execution Environments

For specialized deployments:

[source,yaml]
----
__meta__:
  deployer:
    execution_environment:
      image: quay.io/your-org/custom-ee:latest
      pull: missing
----

=== Network Customization

Advanced networking features:

[source,yaml]
----
# Custom ingress/egress rules
zero_touch_ingress_lockdown_rules:
  - from:
      - ipBlock:
          cidr: "10.0.0.0/8"
    ports:
      - protocol: TCP
        port: 8080

zero_touch_egress_lockdown_rules:
  - ports:
      - protocol: TCP
        port: 443
    to: []  # Allow HTTPS everywhere
----
