== Code Blocks and Commands

=== Interactive Commands

Create copy+run buttons for student commands:

[source,asciidoc]
----
[source,bash]
----
# Students can click to run this
hostname
date
uname -a
----
----

=== Expected Output

Show students what to expect:

[source,asciidoc]
----
.Expected Output
----
lab-server.example.com
Wed Dec 13 10:30:45 EST 2023
Linux lab-server 5.14.0-362.el9.x86_64 #1 SMP x86_64 GNU/Linux
----
----

=== Multi-step Commands

Break complex tasks into steps:

[source,asciidoc]
----
== Step 1: Install Package

[source,bash]
----
dnf install -y httpd
----

== Step 2: Start Service  

[source,bash]
----
systemctl enable --now httpd
----

== Step 3: Verify Installation

[source,bash]
----
systemctl status httpd
----

## Content Writing Best Practices

=== Keep Students Engaged
* **Clear objectives** at the start
* **Step-by-step progression** with validation
* **Immediate feedback** and results
* **Real-world context** and examples

=== Structure for Learning
* **15-20 minute modules** maximum
* **2-5 minute steps** within modules  
* **One concept per section**
* **Progressive complexity**

=== Make Commands Clear
* **Copy+run buttons** for all commands
* **Expected output** for validation
* **Context** before and after commands
* **Troubleshooting** for common issues

=== Write Effective Instructions

**Good:**
[source,asciidoc]
----
== Install and Configure Apache

Install the Apache web server:

[source,bash]
----
dnf install -y httpd
----

Start the service and enable it to start at boot:

[source,bash]  
----
systemctl enable --now httpd
----

Verify Apache is running:

[source,bash]
----
systemctl status httpd
----

.Expected Output
----
‚óè httpd.service - The Apache HTTP Server
   Active: active (running) since...
----
----

**Avoid:**
[source,asciidoc]
----
Run these commands:
dnf install -y httpd
systemctl enable --now httpd
systemctl status httpd
----

== Testing Your Content

=== Local Preview
[source,bash]
----
# Build documentation locally
antora generate site.yml

# Check for formatting issues
grep -r "xref:" content/modules/ROOT/pages/
----

=== Content Checklist
- [ ] Clear learning objectives
- [ ] Step-by-step progression
- [ ] Copy+run buttons on commands
- [ ] Expected output sections
- [ ] Summary of accomplishments
- [ ] Troubleshooting guidance

== Common Mistakes to Avoid

* **Too much information** in one module
* **Missing context** for commands
* **No validation steps** for students
* **Broken cross-references** 
* **Inconsistent formatting**
