= Module 2.3: Simple Content Creation
:estimated-time: 15-20 minutes

== Learning Objectives

Upon completion, you will understand:

* Basic lab instruction creation using AsciiDoc
* Lab content file creation procedures
* Zero Touch copy+run feature usage
* Simple, effective learning content structure

== Overview

Now that you have infrastructure running, let's create engaging content that guides students through your lab environment.

== Step 1: AsciiDoc Essentials

=== Basic Syntax You Need

[source,asciidoc]
----
= Module Title (Level 0 - only one per file)
== Section Title (Level 1)
=== Subsection Title (Level 2)

*Bold text* and _italic text_

[source,bash]
----
echo "Copy+run commands like this"
----

NOTE: Important information goes in notes

WARNING: Critical warnings use this format
----

=== The Power of Copy+Run

Zero Touch automatically adds copy+run buttons to code blocks:

[source,bash]
----
hostname
ip addr show
----

Students click the button and commands execute automatically.

== Step 2: Create Your First Module

=== Create the Content File

Create `content/modules/ROOT/pages/lab-introduction.adoc`:

[source,asciidoc]
----
= Welcome to Your RHEL Lab Environment
:estimated-time: 10 minutes

== What You'll Learn

In this lab, you will:

* Explore a RHEL 9 system
* Understand basic Linux commands  
* Learn about your lab environment

== Lab Environment

You have access to:

* **Lab Server**: A RHEL 9 system with basic tools installed
* **Terminal Access**: Web-based SSH to your systems
* **Root Access**: Full administrative privileges

== Step 1: System Exploration

Let's start by exploring your system:

[source,bash]
----
# Check system information
cat /etc/redhat-release
uname -a
----

.Expected Output
----
Red Hat Enterprise Linux release 9.x
Linux lab-server 5.x.x-xxx.el9.x86_64 ...
----

=== What This Tells Us

The commands above show:
* **OS Version**: Which version of RHEL you're running
* **Kernel**: The Linux kernel version and architecture

== Step 2: Network Basics

Check your network configuration:

[source,bash]
----
# View network interfaces
ip addr show
----

Try connecting to other systems (if you have them):

[source,bash]
----
# Test connectivity
ping -c 3 google.com
----

== Summary

You've successfully:
* Explored your RHEL system
* Checked network connectivity
* Used basic Linux commands

== What's Next?

Continue with additional modules to dive deeper into RHEL administration and your specific lab objectives.
----

=== Update Navigation

Add your new module to `ui-config.yml` modules list:

[source,yaml]
----
- name: lab-introduction  
  label: "Lab Introduction"
  solveButton: false
----

== Step 3: Test Your Content

Build and view your content:

[source,bash]
----
# Generate documentation
antora generate site.yml

# Serve locally (if available)
antora serve site.yml
----

== Content Writing Tips

=== Keep It Simple
* **One concept per section**
* **Clear, actionable steps**
* **Immediate validation/feedback**

=== Use Interactive Features
* **Copy+run buttons** for all commands
* **Expected output** sections for validation
* **Notes and warnings** for important information

=== Structure for Success
* **Learning objectives** at the start
* **Step-by-step progression**
* **Summary** with accomplishments

== Quick Checklist

Before moving on, verify:
* [ ] Content file created
* [ ] Basic AsciiDoc syntax working
* [ ] Copy+run buttons appear on commands
* [ ] Navigation updated
* [ ] Content builds without errors

== Summary

You now know how to:
* Create engaging lab content using AsciiDoc
* Use Zero Touch interactive features
* Structure content for effective learning
* Test your content locally

== Troubleshooting

**Commands don't have copy+run buttons?**  
→ Check that code blocks use proper `[source,bash]` format

**Content doesn't appear in navigation?**  
→ Verify ui-config.yml has correct module name

**Build fails?**  
→ Check AsciiDoc syntax, especially = headers and ---- fences
