= Module 1: RHEL Basics and System Exploration

Welcome to your first hands-on RHEL lab! You'll explore a multi-server environment and learn essential Linux administration commands.

== Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

* Navigate the Linux filesystem confidently
* Check system information and resources
* Understand network configuration in a multi-server environment
* Use essential troubleshooting commands

== Lab Environment Overview

Your lab includes three servers:

[cols="1,2,2"]
|===
|Server |Role |Networks

|**control-server**
|Management and administration
|All networks (default, frontend, backend)

|**web-server**  
|Web application hosting
|Frontend network only

|**database-server**
|Data storage and management
|Backend network only
|===

💡 **Tip**: Use the terminal tabs at the top to switch between servers!

== Step 1: System Information and Exploration

Let's start by exploring the control server to understand our environment.

=== Check System Details

First, let's see what system we're working with:

[source,bash]
----
hostnamectl
----

You should see output showing:
- Operating system (Red Hat Enterprise Linux)
- Kernel version
- Architecture
- Hostname

=== Explore the Filesystem

Navigate around the filesystem to get familiar:

[source,bash]
----
# See where you are
pwd

# List files and directories
ls -la

# Check disk usage
df -h

# See memory usage
free -h
----

**📝 What to Notice**:
- `/` is the root of the filesystem
- `/home/rhel` is your home directory
- The system has adequate disk space and memory

=== Check Running Processes

See what's currently running:

[source,bash]
----
# Show running processes
ps aux | head -10

# Show system resource usage
top
# (Press 'q' to quit)
----

✅ **Validation**: You should see various system processes running, including `systemd`, `kernel` threads, and network services.

== Step 2: Network Configuration Exploration

Now let's understand how networking is configured in this multi-server environment.

=== Check Network Interfaces

View the network interfaces on the control server:

[source,bash]
----
# Show all network interfaces
ip addr show

# Show just the IP addresses
ip addr show | grep "inet 10\."
----

**📝 What to Notice**:
- The control server has multiple network interfaces
- Each interface has an IP address in a different subnet:
  - 10.0.x.x (default/management network)
  - 10.1.x.x (frontend network)  
  - 10.2.x.x (backend network)

=== Test Network Connectivity

Let's verify that our multi-network setup is working:

[source,bash]
----
# Test internet connectivity
ping -c 3 8.8.8.8

# Test connectivity to frontend network gateway
ping -c 3 10.1.0.1

# Test connectivity to backend network gateway  
ping -c 3 10.2.0.1
----

✅ **Validation**: All ping tests should succeed, showing the control server can reach all networks.

== Step 3: Explore Other Servers

Now let's switch to the other servers and see how network isolation works.

=== Web Server Exploration

Click the **">_ web"** tab to access the web server.

Check its network configuration:

[source,bash]
----
# Check hostname
hostnamectl | grep hostname

# Check network interfaces
ip addr show | grep "inet 10\."

# Try to reach backend network (this should fail)
ping -c 3 10.2.0.1
----

**📝 What to Notice**:
- Web server only has frontend network access (10.1.x.x)
- Cannot reach backend network (10.2.x.x) - this is intentional isolation!

=== Database Server Exploration

Click the **">_ database"** tab to access the database server.

[source,bash]
----
# Check hostname  
hostnamectl | grep hostname

# Check network interfaces
ip addr show | grep "inet 10\."

# Try to reach frontend network (this should fail)
ping -c 3 10.1.0.1

# Check if MariaDB packages are installed
rpm -qa | grep mariadb
----

**📝 What to Notice**:
- Database server only has backend network access (10.2.x.x)
- Cannot reach frontend network (10.1.x.x) - network isolation working!
- MariaDB database software is pre-installed

== Step 4: Understanding Network Isolation

This demonstrates a **security best practice**: network segmentation.

=== Why Network Isolation Matters

* **Security**: Limits blast radius of compromises
* **Performance**: Reduces broadcast traffic
* **Compliance**: Many standards require network segmentation
* **Troubleshooting**: Easier to isolate problems

=== How Our Lab Demonstrates This

```
Internet ←→ [default] ←→ control-server ←→ [frontend] ←→ web-server
                              ↕
                         [backend] ←→ database-server
```

- **Control server**: Can manage all networks (typical for admin servers)
- **Web server**: Only frontend access (DMZ pattern)
- **Database server**: Only backend access (protected internal resources)

== Step 5: Useful Administrative Commands

Let's learn some essential commands you'll use regularly:

=== System Monitoring

Back on the **control server** (">_ control" tab):

[source,bash]
----
# System uptime and load
uptime

# Disk usage by directory
du -sh /var/log /tmp /home

# Check system services status
systemctl status sshd
systemctl status NetworkManager

# View recent system logs
journalctl -n 20
----

=== File and Directory Operations

[source,bash]
----
# Create a test directory
mkdir ~/lab-test

# Create a test file
echo "Hello from $(hostname)" > ~/lab-test/server-info.txt

# View the file
cat ~/lab-test/server-info.txt

# Copy file with timestamp
cp ~/lab-test/server-info.txt ~/lab-test/backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).txt

# List what we created
ls -la ~/lab-test/
----

=== Network Troubleshooting

[source,bash]
----
# Show routing table
ip route

# Show network connections
ss -tuln

# Test DNS resolution
nslookup google.com

# Check which ports are listening
ss -tuln | grep LISTEN
----

✅ **Validation**: You should see SSH (port 22) listening and various system services running.
