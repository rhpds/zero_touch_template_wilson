= Template Customization Guide

This comprehensive reference guide covers how to customize the Zero Touch template to meet your specific lab requirements. The template provides a flexible framework that can be extended and modified for various use cases.

üí° **New to Zero Touch?** Consider starting with our xref:zero-touch-platform-training.adoc[**Self-Paced Training Program**] for step-by-step guidance.

== Overview

The template allows you to customize several key aspects:

* **Instances**: Add virtual machines and containers to your lab environment
* **Networking**: Configure custom networks and connectivity between instances
* **Firewall**: Define ingress and egress rules for network security
* **Content**: Create educational content using AsciiDoc and configure the lab interface
* **UI Configuration**: Set up navigation, tabs, and interactive elements

== Configuration Files

Template customization involves several key configuration files:

=== Infrastructure Configuration (`config/` directory)

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|File |Purpose

|`instances.yaml`
|Defines virtual machines and containers, including their specifications, networks, and services

|`networks.yaml`
|Configures custom networks and network topology

|`firewall.yaml`
|Sets up ingress and egress firewall rules for network security
|===

=== Content and UI Configuration

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|File |Purpose

|`ui-config.yml`
|Configures lab navigation, modules, and interface tabs

|`site.yml`
|Sets global variables and theme configuration

|`content/modules/ROOT/pages/*.adoc`
|Educational content written in AsciiDoc format

|`content/antora.yml`
|Antora configuration with inline variables for content rendering
|===

== Quick Start Checklist

Before customizing your template:

. [ ] Clone your template repository
. [ ] Review existing configuration files
. [ ] Plan your lab architecture
. [ ] Identify required instances and their specifications
. [ ] Design network topology if custom networking is needed
. [ ] Determine firewall requirements

== Customization Workflow

. **Design Phase**: Plan your lab environment, learning objectives, and user journey
. **Configure Infrastructure**: Update YAML configuration files for instances, networking, and firewall
. **Create Content**: Develop educational modules using AsciiDoc
. **Configure UI**: Set up navigation, tabs, and interactive elements in `ui-config.yml`
. **Test Locally**: Validate configuration, content, and user interface
. **Deploy**: Push changes and provision lab environment

== Best Practices

* Start with minimal changes and iterate
* Use descriptive names for instances and networks
* Document any custom configurations
* Test firewall rules thoroughly
* Keep security considerations in mind
* Version control all changes
* Review advanced features for Business Unit specific requirements
* Test lab scenarios thoroughly before deployment
* Consider platform architecture when designing complex labs

== ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

=== Bastion Host Requirement

**At least ONE VM MUST be tagged with the "bastions" Ansible group:**

[source,yaml]
----
virtualmachines:
  - name: "bastion-host"         # At least one bastion required
    tags:
      - key: "AnsibleGroup"
        value: "bastions"        # ‚Üê REQUIRED for deployment
      - key: "ostype"
        value: "linux"
        
  - name: "web-server"          # Other VMs can use different groups
    tags:
      - key: "AnsibleGroup"
        value: "webservers"      # ‚Üê Different group OK
      - key: "ostype"
        value: "linux"
----

The bastion host provides SSH access, user accounts, and terminal integration. Other VMs can use appropriate Ansible groups for their roles (webservers, databases, etc.). Without any bastion, deployment will **fail completely**.
