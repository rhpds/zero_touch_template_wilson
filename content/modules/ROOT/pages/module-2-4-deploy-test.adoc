= Module 2.4: Deploy & Test
:estimated-time: 10-15 minutes

== Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:

* Validate your complete lab configuration
* Understand the deployment process
* Test all components work together correctly
* Know how to troubleshoot common issues

== Overview

Before deploying your lab to students, it's crucial to validate that everything works correctly. This module guides you through comprehensive testing and shows you the deployment workflow.

== 🛠️ Step 1: Pre-Deployment Validation

Let's systematically check all components of your lab:

=== Configuration File Validation

Check all YAML files for syntax and consistency:

[source,bash]
----
echo "=== Validating YAML Syntax ==="
for file in config/*.yaml *.yml; do
  if python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('$file'))" 2>/dev/null; then
    echo "✅ $file: Valid YAML"
  else
    echo "❌ $file: YAML Error - check syntax"
    python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('$file'))" 2>&1
  fi
done
----

=== Network Reference Validation

Ensure all networks used by VMs are properly defined:

[source,bash]
----
echo "=== Network Reference Check ==="
echo "Networks used by VMs:"
grep -A 20 "networks:" config/instances.yaml | grep "^  *- " | sort -u

echo -e "\nNetworks defined:"
grep "^- name:" config/networks.yaml

echo -e "\n=== Checking for undefined networks ==="
# This will show any networks referenced but not defined
networks_used=$(grep -A 20 "networks:" config/instances.yaml | grep "^  *- " | sed 's/^  *- //' | sort -u)
networks_defined=$(grep "^- name:" config/networks.yaml | awk '{print $3}' | sort -u)

for network in $networks_used; do
  if ! echo "$networks_defined" | grep -q "^$network$"; then
    echo "❌ Network '$network' used but not defined in networks.yaml"
  else
    echo "✅ Network '$network' properly defined"
  fi
done
----

=== Resource Planning Validation

Check that resource allocation is reasonable:

[source,bash]
----
echo "=== Resource Summary ==="
vm_count=$(grep -c "^  - name:" config/instances.yaml)
total_memory=$(grep "memory:" config/instances.yaml | grep -o "[0-9]*G" | sed 's/G//' | awk '{sum+=$1} END {print sum}')
total_cores=$(grep "cores:" config/instances.yaml | awk '{sum+=$2} END {print sum}')

echo "Virtual Machines: $vm_count"
echo "Total Memory: ${total_memory}G"
echo "Total CPU Cores: $total_cores"

# Basic resource warnings
if [ "$total_memory" -gt 16 ]; then
  echo "⚠️  High memory usage (${total_memory}G) - ensure cluster capacity"
fi

if [ "$total_cores" -gt 8 ]; then
  echo "⚠️  High CPU usage ($total_cores cores) - ensure cluster capacity"
fi

if [ "$vm_count" -gt 5 ]; then
  echo "⚠️  Many VMs ($vm_count) - consider if all are necessary"
fi
----

== 🛠️ Step 2: Content Validation

=== Check Content Files

Verify your content files exist and are structured correctly:

[source,bash]
----
echo "=== Content File Check ==="
content_dir="content/modules/ROOT/pages"

# Check required files exist
required_files=("index.adoc" "01-rhel-basics.adoc")
for file in "${required_files[@]}"; do
  if [ -f "$content_dir/$file" ]; then
    echo "✅ $file exists"
    # Basic AsciiDoc validation
    if grep -q "^= " "$content_dir/$file"; then
      echo "  ✅ Has proper AsciiDoc title"
    else
      echo "  ❌ Missing AsciiDoc title (should start with '= ')"
    fi
  else
    echo "❌ $file missing"
  fi
done

# Check for common AsciiDoc issues
echo -e "\n=== AsciiDoc Quality Check ==="
for file in $content_dir/*.adoc; do
  filename=$(basename "$file")
  echo "Checking $filename:"
  
  # Check for learning objectives
  if grep -q "Learning Objectives\|== Learning Objectives" "$file"; then
    echo "  ✅ Has learning objectives"
  else
    echo "  ⚠️  Consider adding learning objectives"
  fi
  
  # Check for code blocks
  if grep -q "\[source," "$file"; then
    echo "  ✅ Contains interactive code blocks"
  else
    echo "  ⚠️  No code blocks found - add hands-on exercises"
  fi
  
  # Check for validation points
  if grep -q "✅\|Validation" "$file"; then
    echo "  ✅ Contains validation points"
  else
    echo "  ⚠️  Consider adding validation checkpoints"
  fi
done
----

=== UI Configuration Validation

Check that UI configuration matches your content:

[source,bash]
----
echo "=== UI Configuration Check ==="

# Check ui-config.yml structure
if python3 -c "import yaml; config=yaml.safe_load(open('ui-config.yml')); print('antora' in config and 'tabs' in config)" 2>/dev/null | grep -q True; then
  echo "✅ ui-config.yml has required sections"
else
  echo "❌ ui-config.yml missing required 'antora' or 'tabs' sections"
fi

# Check module references
echo -e "\nModules in ui-config.yml:"
python3 -c "
import yaml
try:
    config = yaml.safe_load(open('ui-config.yml'))
    for module in config.get('antora', {}).get('modules', []):
        print(f\"  {module.get('name', 'unnamed')}: {module.get('label', 'no label')}\")
except Exception as e:
    print(f'Error reading ui-config.yml: {e}')
"

# Check tabs configuration
echo -e "\nTabs configured:"
python3 -c "
import yaml
try:
    config = yaml.safe_load(open('ui-config.yml'))
    for tab in config.get('tabs', []):
        print(f\"  {tab.get('name', 'unnamed')}: {tab.get('url', tab.get('type', 'unknown'))}\")
except Exception as e:
    print(f'Error reading ui-config.yml: {e}')
"
----

== 🛠️ Step 3: Site Configuration Test

Verify your site configuration is correct:

[source,bash]
----
echo "=== Site Configuration Check ==="

# Check site.yml
if [ -f "site.yml" ]; then
  echo "✅ site.yml exists"
  
  # Check required sections
  if grep -q "^site:" site.yml; then
    echo "  ✅ Has 'site' section"
  else
    echo "  ❌ Missing 'site' section"
  fi
  
  if grep -q "^content:" site.yml; then
    echo "  ✅ Has 'content' section"
  else
    echo "  ❌ Missing 'content' section"
  fi
  
  if grep -q "^ui:" site.yml; then
    echo "  ✅ Has 'ui' section"
  else
    echo "  ❌ Missing 'ui' section"
  fi
  
  # Check start page
  start_page=$(grep "start_page:" site.yml | awk '{print $2}')
  if [ ! -z "$start_page" ]; then
    echo "  ✅ Start page configured: $start_page"
    # Verify the start page file exists
    page_file=$(echo "$start_page" | sed 's/modules:://' | sed 's/::.*//')
    if [ -f "content/modules/ROOT/pages/$page_file" ]; then
      echo "    ✅ Start page file exists"
    else
      echo "    ❌ Start page file missing: content/modules/ROOT/pages/$page_file"
    fi
  else
    echo "  ❌ No start page configured"
  fi
else
  echo "❌ site.yml missing"
fi
----

== 🛠️ Step 4: End-to-End Simulation

Let's simulate the student experience by checking key workflows:

=== Test VM SSH Access Patterns

Verify that the UI configuration matches the actual VMs:

[source,bash]
----
echo "=== VM Access Pattern Check ==="

# Get VM names from instances.yaml
echo "VMs defined in instances.yaml:"
grep "^  - name:" config/instances.yaml | awk '{print "  " $3}' | tr -d '"'

# Get SSH paths from ui-config.yml tabs
echo -e "\nSSH paths in ui-config.yml:"
python3 -c "
import yaml
try:
    config = yaml.safe_load(open('ui-config.yml'))
    for tab in config.get('tabs', []):
        if 'path' in tab and '/ssh/' in tab['path']:
            vm_name = tab['path'].split('/ssh/')[-1]
            print(f\"  {vm_name} (from tab: {tab.get('name', 'unnamed')})\")
except Exception as e:
    print(f'Error: {e}')
"

echo -e "\n=== Cross-Reference Check ==="
# This would require more complex scripting to fully validate
echo "✅ Manual verification required:"
echo "  1. Each VM in instances.yaml should have a corresponding terminal tab"
echo "  2. Each terminal tab should reference a VM that exists"
echo "  3. Tab names should be descriptive and consistent"
----

=== Content Flow Test

Check that the content flows logically:

[source,bash]
----
echo "=== Content Flow Check ==="

# Check for proper cross-references
echo "Cross-references found:"
grep -r "xref:" content/modules/ROOT/pages/ | head -5

# Check for broken internal links (basic check)
echo -e "\nChecking for potential broken internal references:"
for file in content/modules/ROOT/pages/*.adoc; do
  filename=$(basename "$file" .adoc)
  # Look for references to this file from other files
  refs=$(grep -l "xref:$filename" content/modules/ROOT/pages/*.adoc 2>/dev/null | wc -l)
  if [ "$refs" -gt 0 ]; then
    echo "  $filename.adoc: Referenced by $refs other files"
  fi
done
----

== 🛠️ Step 5: Deployment Readiness Check

=== Final Validation Summary

[source,bash]
----
echo "=== DEPLOYMENT READINESS SUMMARY ==="
echo ""

# Configuration
echo "📁 CONFIGURATION:"
config_issues=0

for file in config/instances.yaml config/networks.yaml config/firewall.yaml; do
  if python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('$file'))" 2>/dev/null; then
    echo "  ✅ $file: Valid"
  else
    echo "  ❌ $file: Invalid YAML"
    config_issues=$((config_issues + 1))
  fi
done

# Content
echo -e "\n📚 CONTENT:"
content_issues=0

required_content=("content/modules/ROOT/pages/index.adoc" "ui-config.yml" "site.yml")
for file in "${required_content[@]}"; do
  if [ -f "$file" ]; then
    echo "  ✅ $file: Present"
  else
    echo "  ❌ $file: Missing"
    content_issues=$((content_issues + 1))
  fi
done

# Summary
echo -e "\n🎯 OVERALL STATUS:"
total_issues=$((config_issues + content_issues))

if [ "$total_issues" -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "  ✅ READY FOR DEPLOYMENT"
  echo "     Your lab configuration appears correct!"
else
  echo "  ❌ ISSUES FOUND: $total_issues"
  echo "     Please resolve issues before deployment"
fi

echo -e "\n📊 LAB SUMMARY:"
echo "  VMs: $(grep -c "^  - name:" config/instances.yaml)"
echo "  Networks: $(grep -c "^- name:" config/networks.yaml)"
echo "  Content Pages: $(ls content/modules/ROOT/pages/*.adoc 2>/dev/null | wc -l)"
echo "  Total Memory: $(grep "memory:" config/instances.yaml | grep -o "[0-9]*G" | sed 's/G//' | awk '{sum+=$1} END {print sum}')G"

== 🚀 Understanding the Deployment Process

=== What Happens During Deployment

When your lab is deployed, Zero Touch performs these steps:

. **Repository Clone**: Your lab configuration is pulled from Git
. **Infrastructure Provisioning**: 
   - VMs are created with specified resources
   - Networks are configured according to your topology
   - Firewall rules are applied
. **Content Building**: AsciiDoc files are converted to web content
. **Environment Setup**: 
   - `setup-automation/main.yml` runs to configure VMs
   - Packages are installed
   - Services are configured
. **Platform Integration**: 
   - Terminal access is established
   - Web interface is configured
   - Monitoring is enabled
. **Student Access**: Lab becomes available to users

=== Deployment Timeline

* **Infrastructure**: 2-3 minutes
* **Content Building**: 30-60 seconds  
* **Setup Automation**: 1-3 minutes (depends on complexity)
* **Total Time**: Typically 5-10 minutes

=== Common Deployment Issues

**Resource Constraints**:
- **Symptom**: VMs fail to provision
- **Solution**: Reduce memory/CPU allocation or VM count

**Network Conflicts**:
- **Symptom**: Network creation fails
- **Solution**: Check CIDR ranges don't conflict with cluster networks

**Content Build Failures**:
- **Symptom**: Web interface shows errors
- **Solution**: Fix AsciiDoc syntax, check file references

**Setup Automation Failures**:
- **Symptom**: VMs provision but aren't configured correctly
- **Solution**: Check `setup-automation/main.yml` syntax and package availability
