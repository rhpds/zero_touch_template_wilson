= Module 2.4: Deploy & Test Your Lab
:estimated-time: 15-20 minutes

== Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:

* Deploy your lab to the Zero Touch platform
* Test your lab environment functionality
* Verify student access and experience
* Troubleshoot common deployment issues

== Overview

You've configured infrastructure, networking, and content. Now it's time to deploy your lab and make sure everything works as expected for students.

== 🛠️ Step 1: Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before deploying, verify your configuration:

[source,bash]
----
# Check all required files exist
ls -la config/
ls -la content/modules/ROOT/pages/
----

.Expected Files
----
config/
├── instances.yaml    # VMs and containers
├── networks.yaml     # Network topology  
├── firewall.yaml     # Security rules
ui-config.yml         # Navigation
site.yml              # Antora configuration
----

=== Validate Configuration Files

[source,bash]
----
# Check YAML syntax
python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('config/instances.yaml'))"
python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('config/networks.yaml'))"
python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('config/firewall.yaml'))"
----

If no errors appear, your YAML is valid.

== 🛠️ Step 2: Build Documentation

Generate your lab content:

[source,bash]
----
# Build documentation
antora generate site.yml
----

.Expected Output
----
[12:34:56.789] INFO (antora): Documents converted successfully
Site generation complete!
----

=== Test Local Preview (if available)

[source,bash]
----
# Serve locally to test
antora serve site.yml
----

Navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to preview your lab.

== 🛠️ Step 3: Commit and Deploy

Push your changes to trigger deployment:

[source,bash]
----
# Add all changes
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "Lab ready for deployment"

# Push to trigger deployment
git push origin main
----

== 🛠️ Step 4: Test Lab Access

Once deployed, test the student experience:

=== Access Your Lab

[source,bash]
----
# Access will be provided via lab platform
# Typically: https://your-lab-url.demo.redhat.com
----

=== Test Terminal Access

* Click terminal tabs in the UI
* Verify SSH connectivity to VMs
* Test copy+run buttons on commands

=== Test VM Functionality

[source,bash]
----
# From lab terminal, test VMs
hostname
ip addr show
ping google.com
----

=== Test Container Services

If you have containers:

[source,bash]
----
# Check container connectivity
curl http://container-name:port
nc -zv container-name port
----

== 🛠️ Step 5: Student Experience Test

Navigate through your content as a student would:

1. **Start with landing page** - Clear objectives?
2. **Follow instructions** - Copy+run buttons work?
3. **Complete each step** - Validation points clear?
4. **Check navigation** - Can students find their way?

== ✅ Deployment Checklist

Verify each item works:

- [ ] **Lab loads** without errors
- [ ] **Terminal access** available
- [ ] **VM connectivity** functional
- [ ] **Container services** accessible
- [ ] **Copy+run buttons** working
- [ ] **Navigation** clear and logical
- [ ] **Content** displays properly
- [ ] **Links** functional

== 🛠️ Common Issues & Solutions

**Lab doesn't load?**
→ Check YAML syntax in configuration files

**Terminal access fails?**
→ Verify firewall rules allow SSH (port 22)

**VMs unreachable?**
→ Check VM status and network configuration

**Containers not responding?**  
→ Verify container image names and ports

**Content not displaying?**
→ Check AsciiDoc syntax and file locations

**Navigation missing?**
→ Verify ui-config.yml module names match files

== 🎯 What You've Accomplished

Congratulations! You have:

✅ **Built a complete lab environment** with VMs, containers, and networking  
✅ **Created engaging educational content** with interactive features  
✅ **Deployed to the Zero Touch platform** successfully  
✅ **Tested the student experience** end-to-end  
✅ **Learned troubleshooting techniques** for common issues  

You're now ready to create professional, interactive labs for your students!
