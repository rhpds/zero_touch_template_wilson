== Development Workflow

=== Initial Setup
1. Clone this repository
2. Review `content/modules/ROOT/pages/zero-touch-platform-training.adoc`
3. Follow `content/modules/ROOT/pages/template-customization-guide.adoc`

=== Configuration
1. Modify infrastructure in `config/` directory
2. Update content in `content/modules/ROOT/pages/`
3. Configure UI in `ui-config.yml`
4. Test locally with Antora

=== Deployment
1. Validate YAML configuration files
2. Commit changes to Git repository
3. Deploy through Zero Touch platform
4. Test student experience end-to-end

## Getting Started

Choose your entry point based on your experience:

=== Quick Start (10-15 minutes)
**For experienced developers:** Jump directly to the Quick Start Guide for rapid onboarding with directory structure, naming conventions, and common patterns.

=== Complete Training (4-6 hours)  
**For comprehensive learning:** Follow the full training modules covering platform fundamentals, hands-on lab creation, and advanced features.

=== Reference Documentation
**For specific topics:** Use the reference guides for VM configuration, container patterns, networking, and enterprise examples.

=== Troubleshooting
**When you need help:** Each guide includes troubleshooting sections with common issues and solutions.

## Template Usage

=== Development Process
1. **Plan**: Define your lab objectives and infrastructure requirements
2. **Configure**: Modify `config/` files for VMs, networks, and security
3. **Create Content**: Write educational content in `content/modules/ROOT/pages/`
4. **Test**: Validate locally with Antora before deployment
5. **Deploy**: Push changes to trigger Zero Touch platform deployment

=== Best Practices
* Start with existing examples and modify incrementally
* Test all configurations locally before deployment
* Follow the established naming conventions
* Reference the troubleshooting sections when issues arise
